            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <!-- DLC Cleaning -->
            <h3 id="cleaning"><b>Why does the guide not clean the DLC plugins?</b></h3>
            Cleaning DLCs is <i>not</i> necessary, and it won't lead to any performance/stability gains.

            <!-- MO2 Popup -->
            <h3 id="mo2Popup"><b>When installing multiple mods from the same page through MO2, should I select Merge, Rename, or Replace?</b></h3>
            Read the <strong>Mod Installation Instructions</strong> section from the <a href="./mo2.html#installation_instructions" target="_blank">MO2</a> page.

            <!-- App Error -->
            <h3 id="appError"><b>Why do I get a <code>Application Load Error 5:0000065434</code> message when I try to launch the game?</b></h3>
            Run your game directly through Steam once. You may also need to restart Steam and/or Mod Organizer 2. If that still doesn't work, place a copy of your <strong>Steam.exe</strong> (not a shortcut) into the game's <strong>Root</strong> folder.

            <!-- Conflicts -->
            <h3 id="mo2Conflicts"><b>Mod Organizer 2 is reporting that mods in the left pane have overwritten loose files. Is this okay?</b></h3>
            <p>Yes, as long as your mods in the <b>left</b> pane of MO2 are in the exact order as they appear in the guide, these overwrites are intentional and safe.</p>

            <!-- Overwrite -->
            <h3 id="mo2Overwrite"><b>Mod Organizer 2 is reporting that there are files in my overwrite folder. Is this okay?</b></h3>
            <p>Yes, generally these files are harmless. They are usually files generated by mods (like configuration INI files) or by programs ran through MO2. These files will still be loaded fine in-game, and will be prioritized as if they are the last mod in the <b>left</b> pane of MO2. Usually, you can just leave these files in the overwrite and ignore the warning.</p>

            <!-- DLC -->
            <h3 id="dlc"><b>Why should I not use the High Resolution Texture Pack DLC?</b></h3>
            The texture pack DLC provides a very marginal visual increase for a potentially major performance decrease. It is simply not worth the trade-off.

            <!-- Textures -->
            <h3 id="textures"><b>Why are there no big visual mods in the guide? Can I add my own?</b></h3>
            The headroom you have for visual mods highly depends on hardware, especially VRAM. Including big mods would raise the requirements of the guide too much to still call it vanilla+. The game can also suffer a lot from replacing assets with mods which are usually loose files. So for a proper visual overhaul you will also need to know how to pack files into archives.

            <!-- MCM Error -->
            <h3 id="mcmError"><b>Why do I get a <code>Wrong HUDMenu.swf found</code> error in the FallUI HUD MCM?</b></h3>
            You did not enable <strong>recommended tweaks</strong> as instructed in the <strong>BethINI</strong> section from the <a href="./mo2.html#bethini" target="_blank">MO2</a> page. If this does not fix it then you did not disable <strong>profile-specific INI files</strong> as instructed in the <strong>Profiles</strong> section of the same page.
