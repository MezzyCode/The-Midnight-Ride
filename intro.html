            The Midnight Ride is a modding guide for Fallout 4 that will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth and enjoyable experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience. It is still incredibly important that you read all the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough to skip them. There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide, it is expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Stability:</b> The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous mods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Performance:</b> Every tool, setting and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance. With the recommended specs listed below, you can expect ~60 FPS in the heavier areas of Boston.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Customizability:</b> The guide is split into <b>2 sections</b>; all the mods required for the game to work and perform better are contained in the first section. The mods that can be considered subjective and that alter or add game content are in the <strong>TMR Extended</strong> section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Better Gameplay:</b> As part of the <b>TMR Extended</b> section, the guide includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's original intent.

            The guide will make the game run better than vanilla. The game is much more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive, and actually scales with modern hardware pretty well. Installing the game on an SSD will drastically improve loading times and decrease stuttering. Here are the recommended specs for being able to run the guide at 60 FPS at 1080p:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>CPU:</b> Matching or surpassing the single-thread performance of a Ryzen 5 1600.</li>
                <li><b>RAM:</b> 8GB or more.</li>
                <li><b>GPU:</b> Matching or surpassing the performance of a GTX 780 or R9 290. 3GB or more of VRAM.</li>
            </ul>
