				<p>Welcome to The Midnight Ride, a modular vanilla-plus modding guide for Fallout 4!</p>
				<blockquote>
					<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
					<br>
					Everything in this guide is written down for a reason! It is vital to read <b>everything!</b>
					<br>
					You can <b>NOT</b> skip any paragraphs/instructions and expect your game to function as it should.

				<h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
				<p>The Midnight Ride is a modding guide for Fallout 4 that will carefully walk you through how to install all
					the mods you will need for a perfectly stable, smooth and enjoyable experience.
				</p>
				<p>The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience. It is still incredibly
					important that you read all the instructions very carefully, even if you believe you are experienced enough
					to skip them. There are many small instructions that are vital for your game to function, and could be
					easily missed if you aren't careful. Although you don't need any modding experience to use this guide, it is
					expected for you to be relatively experienced with operating a computer in general.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="features"><a href="#features">Features</a></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Stability:</b> The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous
						mods.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Performance:</b> Every tool, setting and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and
						play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance. With the recommended specs listed below, you can
						expect ~60 FPS in the heavier areas of Boston.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Customizability:</b> The guide is split into <b>2 sections</b>; all the mods required for the
						game to work and perform better are contained in the first section. The mods that can be considered
						subjective and that alter or add game content are in the <strong>TMR Extended</strong> section.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Better Gameplay:</b> As part of the <b>TMR Extended</b> section, the guide includes many mods
						that greatly improve the gameplay without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying
						away from the game's original intent.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="requirements"><a href="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
				<ul>
					<li>An <b>English</b> copy of the game with all DLCs from either <a
							href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/199943/">Steam</a> or <a
							href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_4_game_of_the_year_edition">GOG</a>.
						<ul>
							<li>Only the English version of the game is supported for maximum compatibility; translations can
								conflict with mods and cause issues. The Bethesda.net and Xbox Game Pass versions of the game
								are also unsupported, as they do not work with F4SE, which is essential for many mods.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>At least 48GB of free drive space, game included (42GB if you delete all the downloads).</li>
					<li>Windows 10 or higher (64-bit).</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener">VC++ Runtime Libraries</a>.
						<ul>
							<li>Extract the archive and run the included <strong>install_all.bat</strong> as an administrator to
								install all of the required libraries at once.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>A text editor (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notepad++</a> is
						recommended, but the default Windows notepad will work).</li>
					<li>An archiving tool (<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/nanazip/9N8G7TSCL18R?hl=en-us&gl=us"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener">NanaZip</a> is recommended).</li>
					<li>The latest GPU drivers (either <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD</a>
						or
						<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-dch-drivers.html"
							target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel</a>).
					</li>

				<p>The guide will make the game run better than vanilla. The game is much more CPU-intensive than
					GPU-intensive, and actually scales with modern hardware pretty well. Installing the game on an SSD will
					drastically improve loading times and decrease stuttering. Here are the recommended specs for being able to
					run the guide at 60 FPS at 1080p:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>CPU:</b> Matching or surpassing the single-thread performance of a Ryzen 5 1600.</li>
					<li><b>RAM:</b> 8GB or more.</li>
					<li><b>GPU:</b> Matching or surpassing the performance of a GTX 780 or R9 290. 3GB or more of VRAM.</li>
				</ul>
