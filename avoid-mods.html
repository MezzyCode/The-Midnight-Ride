            <h1>Mods to Avoid</h1>
            <blockquote>
                This list is far from comprehensive. There are still tons of mods not listed here that will break your game. This is why it is very important to have some modding knowledge before adding any mods.
                <br>
                Always view every plugin you install with <a href="https://moddinglinked.com/xedit.html" target="_blank">FO4Edit</a> to check for conflicts.

            <!-- Oversized Textures -->
            <p>
                <strong>Oversized textures</strong>
                <br>
                Based on the object size and how the texture is wrapped around it, you should pick textures with a reasonable resolution and avoid the very big ones also based on your display resolution. Keep in mind that the textures will not be displayed with their full resolution at all times, in fact they will be scaled down because of <a href="https://imgsli.com/MTMwNjU2" target="" _blank>mipmaps</a> based on distance and other factors, as shown with these sliders. Just for reference, a maximum of 2K at 1080p is a pretty safe bet in terms of balance.
            </p>

            <!-- AI Upscales -->
            <p>
                <strong>AI-upscaled texture packs</strong>
                <br>
                Mods upscaled with AI or other lazy techniques generally are not worth the higher VRAM usage.
            </p>

            <!-- Timescale -->
            <p>
                <strong>Any mods that edit timescale</strong>
                <br>
                Vanilla AI packages and scripts are based on the vanilla timescale, and can break and/or run when they aren't supposed to if the timescale is changed.
            </p>

                <br>
                The assumption with all these is that they simply don't know anything about proper modding and lead users to broken setups, while often making them pay money for it.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sinitar</b>, if you have a few hours and want more information about Sinitar's lies, scamming and lack of modding knowledge, check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F1-6lF8dI4i2Zz8iT-bv_Ci1VO9MSU4MiSUrT5JqgHA/edit" target="_blank">this</a> <i>twenty-eight</i> page essay that goes into excruciating detail about it.</li>

                <li><b>DerekDiablo</b>.</li>
                <li><b>ESO</b>, also runs an online store for pre-built computers with insane prices and questionable part choices.</li>
                <li><b>GamerPoets</b>, most videos are misinformed (reason why they were recently marked as such in bulk). Proved to have a bad attitude towards feedback by hiding comments that correct him and then announcing to his Discord server how proper information isn't really the focus of the videos.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <!-- ENBoost -->
            <p>
                <strong>ENBoost</strong>
                <br>
                Completely unnecessary on Fallout 4 and unsupported.
            </p>

            <!-- FO4FI FPS Fix -->
            <p>
                <strong>FO4FI FPS Fix</strong>
                <br>
                Causes crashes in some locations.
            </p>

            <!-- Official HD DLC -->
            <p>
                <strong>Fallout 4 Official HD Texture Pack DLC</strong>
                <br>
                Almost twice the size of the base game on its own, not worth the extra VRAM usage (from around 3GB to 5.5GB on average) considered how close it looks to vanilla.
            </p>

            <!-- FPSL -->
            <p>
                <strong>FPSL - Lighting and Tweaks Performance</strong>
                <br>
                Contains many edits that are not related to the mod's goal at all (such as water output from a pump and generator cost), does not really improve performance in any relevant amount as tested <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775894076410429470/1113992881817014322/image.png" target="" _blank>here</a> and as a result of using it, light sources will look miserable.
            </p>

            <!-- AWKCR -->
            <p>
                <strong>Armor and Weapon Keywords Community Resource</strong>
                <br>
                Extremely bloated and buggy, makes tons of out-of-scope/undocumented changes.
            </p>

            <!-- Armorsmith -->
            <p>
                <strong>Armorsmith Extended</strong>
                <br>
                Old and buggy, not to mention extraordinarily overpowered.
            </p>

            <!-- VIS -->
            <p>
                <strong>VIS/VIS-G</strong>
                <br>
                Requires patches with any mods that change/add literally any items, also makes random changes to item names to make them more "realistic" for some reason.
            </p>

            <!-- Functional Displays -->
            <p>
                <strong>Functional Displays</strong>
                <br>
                Causes crashes, you can fix this by deleting everything in the <b>meshes folder</b> except for the <b>Functional Displays</b> folder.
            </p>

            <!-- Scrap Mods -->
            <p>
                <strong>Scrap Everything/Settlement Cleaning Mods</strong>
                <br>
                Breaks precombineds in settlements.
            </p>

            <!-- Flashlight -->
            <p>
                <strong>Pip-Boy Flashlight</strong>
                <br>
                The shadow option from this will severely affect performance.
            </p>

            <!-- Damage Treshold -->
            <p>
                <strong>Damage Threshold Framework</strong>
                <br>
                Occasionally causes crashes due to calculation errors.
            </p>

            <!-- Tactical Reload -->
            <p>
                <strong>Tactical Reload</strong>
                <br>
                Will cause crashes with weapons that are not specifically patched for it. Before using it, make sure any weapon mods you use have patches from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/52619" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <!-- Beantown -->
            <p>
                <strong>The Beantown Interiors Project</strong>
                <br>
                Breaks precombineds, can accelerate save bloat due to the massive amounts of items in each interior.
            </p>

            <!-- SotS -->
            <p>
                <strong>South of the Sea</strong>
                <br>
                Very buggy and will cause crashes due to deleted nav-meshes. A reworked version is available <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/63152" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <!-- NAC -->
            <p>
                <strong>NAC and NAC X</strong>

            <!-- MOFAM -->
            <p>
                <strong>The MOFAM mod list</strong>
                <br>
                Contains various misinformation about things the author does not understand, seems very selective about who to take feedback from even when shown proof.
            </p>

            <!-- RX9000 -->
            <p>
                <strong>Mods by RX9000</strong>
                <br>
                Misleading information about performance just to get downloads, for example Optimax actually has a higher VRAM usage (<a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1135557693181014046/1161439195701723146/image.png?ex=65384d8a&is=6525d88a&hm=c213ac81957c226e70507e1647ec826327653147dd5e12299b41ea365895249f&=" target="_blank">before</a> and <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1135557693181014046/1161439796045021255/image.png?ex=65384e19&is=6525d919&hm=b14c4a68737448ec2f7758656c217eccaddd33627d3617c61ce71a5cbe6bb45b&=" target="_blank">after</a>) and <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1135557693181014046/1161440599795306656/image.png?ex=65384ed9&is=6525d9d9&hm=b0e45d885601f6703ef60a110571b253095c07f73caac879db07452ed0645ed7&=" target="_blank">higher disk space requirement</a> than vanilla archives (left is the mod and right is vanilla). Also the author hides any mention of this in the comments, because transparency is very hard. His series of "The Midnight" mods are in no way related to this guide.
